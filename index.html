    I shut my Murphy bed, sat down to scratch my head
    What could this day bring? It could be anything
    I get the phone call, I gotta help them all
    "GoGirl, we'll save the day, Chow will not get away"
    It didn't take me long to find the ticking bomb
    He took off in my Jeep, that Chow is such a creep
    I gotta find a way to take down Chow one day
    He pulled a neenja move, it got me to behoove


    Hmm, you know what?
    Ma-Maybe I too could be neenja


    I want to be neenja
    I want to be neenja
    I want to chop, chop, chop Chow down
    Take Chow down to Chinatown
    I want to be neenja


    I started training hard, I think I could go far
    I am a natural, that's matter-of-factual
    I learn to chop real hard, I fight with credit card
    I use my nunchucks, even while feeding ducks
    I throw my neenja star, oh, so very far
    I do karate moves with a GoGirl groove
    I learn my neenja kicks while watching Netflix
    I try do everything like on the big screen


    And you guys, you know what?
    I might do it I might be a neenja soon


    I gonna be neenja
    I gonna be neenja
    I gonna chop, chop, chop Chow down
    Take Chow down to Chinatown
    I gonna be neenja


    I practice every day, I practice every way
    I don't always do good, I really wish I could
    I drink from sippy cup, you know I won't give up
    I gotta try my best, you can't expect no less
    That Chow has not a clue, is too good to be true
    I making progress, feels good, I must confess
    I catch a flying tick with my chopstick
    I take down anyone, hahaha, this is getting fun


    Haha, you guys
    I think I almost a neenja


    I almost a neenja
    I almost a neenja
    I try to chop, chop, chop Chow down
    Take Chow down to Chinatown
    I almost a neenja


    You guys, it's time
    I traveled to the misty mountains of China (misty mountains)
    Om
    I meditate with the ancient Buddha of Asia
    Gives me guidance
    I hear the bells of ancient times
    I meditate, I levitate, I elevate my soul
    My strength, it's coming
    And I open my eyes and envision the goal


    I snuck up to his place, opened my neenja case
    Pulled out my neenja gear, I hope he didn't hear
    I sneak up to his room, he's sleepy I assume
    I didn't think that he would be expecting me
    Pulled out my neenja sword, he hit me with a board
    I came to really fast, gotta get Chow at last
    I tried with all my might to put up a good fight
    Did neenja moves real fast, I took down Chow at last


    Hua
    Yes, I did
    I took down Chow


    I finally neenja
    I finally neenja
    I got to chop, chop, chop Chow down
    Take Chow down to Chinatown
    I finally neenja
